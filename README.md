# Minecraft Advancement Roulette
### A fully functional website to create a unique minecraft challenge for yourself.
This is a Minecraft challenge my friend proposed, where you **must achieve every advancement in Minecraft in a given order,** failing the challenge if you get any advancement that was not given to you. At first we tried using a completely random generator, but quickly found out that wouldn't work. Eventually we decided to make a website for it that would not give completely impossible sequences of achievements, however it is *extremely difficult.* **Try and see how far you can get!**

You can view the deployment [here](https://kaydacant.github.io/minecraft-advancement-roulette/).

This website was *heavily* inspired by the [Geometry Dash Extreme Demon Roulette](https://github.com/matcool/extreme-demon-roulette), so please give that project some love.

Feel free to point out any impossible scenarios, or fix any bugs that you may come across.
