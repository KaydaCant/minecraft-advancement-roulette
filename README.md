# Minecraft Advancement Roulette

## A fully functional website to create a unique minecraft challenge for yourself.

This was a small project of mine, proposed by my friend Mossbafia, who wanted to create a unique challenge in Minecraft. The goal was to use a random generator to get advancements in a random order, however we realised quite quickly that it would generate impossible scenarios most of the time. This website aims to fix that issue and eliminate any impossible series of advancements, and to allow anyone to easily generate a unique challenge every time. The goal is simple:

* Complete all advancements in the given order
* If you collect any other advancement that was not given, you fail.

You can view the website [here](https://kaydacant.github.io/minecraft-advancement-roulette/).
The advancements are currently only on version **1.19**, feel free to make a pull request to update the advancements.json in the future.

This idea and website is heavily inspired by the [Geometry Dash Extreme Demon Roulette](https://github.com/matcool/extreme-demon-roulette) *(hence the similarities in the name)*

Feel free to create an issue outlining any impossible scenarios, or any bugs in my spaghetti code.
